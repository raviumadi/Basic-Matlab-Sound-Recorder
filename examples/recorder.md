# Example Recording

In this example, I show how to use the functions provided to do a recording session, save interim and full recordings, and timestamps. 

The interim data retrieval is handy when the next event of interest is unpredictable. Instead of processing the audio file later, one might find it easier to clip the data as the session progresses. 

The last piece is updated to the current time point at subsequent calls for interim data.

At the end of the session, the program prompts to save the audio and time stamp files.

The example recording in `/rec` folder demonstrates the working with a computer-generated voice counter.
