1. Call `displayAudioDeviceInfo` function to list the available inputs and outputs.

2. Call `SoundRecorderController` without arguments for recording from default input at 44.1 kHz.

3. You may use `SoundRecorderController(deviceID, channelNumbers, numChannels, fs)` where the deviceID is known from 1
4. Use `help SoundRecorderController` to see the details of the remaining parameters
5. Mark regions of interest by pressing `t` to obtain timestamps of the event. This comes in handy for post-processing
6. Extended use: Incorporate in script designs for writing out `.wav` and clipping from timestamp etc.

Have fun!
